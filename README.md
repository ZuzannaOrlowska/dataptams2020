Document/collaborate on analysis using Jupyter notebook or Jupyter lab


## Getting notebooks to run

You should be able to start the notebook server by typing "jupyter lab" or "jupyter notebook"
in command line

 
## Important notes

We don't want to store notebook results in git. Therefore, we'll use this tool:
Make sure to install it in the root directory of the repository.

    $ pip install nbstripout
    $ nbstripout --install

We don't want to store data in git. The general strategy will be to download
the data from our google drive to your local machine
into the relevant data folder, usually suggested in the lab.
